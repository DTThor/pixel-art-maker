# Pixel Art Maker

In this exercise, I created my own pixel art maker which allows a user to choose colors from a palette and then paint pixel art. 

The user stories/goals for this assignment were to do the following:

1. Start with a blank canvas of pixels.
1. Select a brush color from a palette of colors.
1. Paint the pixels on the canvas using the brush color.
1. Repeat step 2.

### Bonus Feature 1

Improve the mouse so it behaves like a real paintbrush. In other words, allow the user to paint by clicking and dragging across the canvas. For this, you'll need a combination of the `mousedown`, `mouseenter`, and `mouseup` events.

### Bonus Feature 2

Add a color picker which allows the user to select any brush color using the [`<input type="color">` tag] and the [`change` event]


This is one of the first working projects I've ever built other than simple, single page websites, and it was during week 3 of my Galvanize journey.  I am excited to see what I will be able to create in the following weeks and months!
